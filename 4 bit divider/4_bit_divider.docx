Pattern observations
-	E_zero is just the nand of all divisor bits (if all are zero, you cannot divide by zero)
-	If the divisor is >0.5*dividend (call the quantity x), the remainder decreases from that point by a factor of 1 for each integer increase in the divisor. The remainder Ris the difference between the divisor and x. 
o	Ex. If divisor = 7 and dividend = 12,
x = 0.5*12 
x = 6
7 > x
R = 12-7
R = 5

If divisor increases by 1, divisor = 8    (+1)
Remainder decreases by 1, R = 5-1 
			      R = 4        (-1)
